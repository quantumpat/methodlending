				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">General Advertising Disclaimer</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					This website is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to lend or a
					commitment to provide financing. Loan programs, rates, terms, and conditions are subject to
					change without notice. Qualification and approval are not guaranteed and depend on borrower
					credit profile, property type, loan purpose, and other underwriting criteria. Method Lending
					NMLS #2753300.
				</p>

				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">TRID/Consumer Loan Disclaimer</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					Consumer-purpose mortgage loans are subject to federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Real
					Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requirements, including Loan Estimates and Closing
					Disclosures provided within required timeframes. Not all applicants will qualify. All loans
					are subject to credit approval and property appraisal.
				</p>

				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">Non-QM Disclaimer</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) loans do not meet the requirements of a Qualified Mortgage as
					defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These loans may include alternative
					documentation standards, different debt-to-income ratio calculations, higher interest rates,
					or unique underwriting criteria. Non-QM loans are not suitable for all borrowers and carry
					different risk profiles than traditional conforming loans. Borrowers should carefully review
					all loan terms and consult with a qualified financial advisor before proceeding.
				</p>

				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">Business Purpose Loan Disclosure</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					Business-purpose loans are intended for investment or commercial use only and are not subject
					to the same consumer protection laws as owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, including
					TRID disclosure requirements. These loans are designed for real estate investors and business
					entities. Different underwriting standards, documentation requirements, and loan terms apply.
					Business-purpose loans are not available for properties that will be used as the borrower&apos;s
					primary residence.

				<h2 className="h3 fw-semibold mt-5">Additional Recommended Disclosures</h2>

				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">Rate and APR Disclaimer (for rate pages)</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					Rates shown are for informational purposes only and are subject to change without notice.
					Your actual rate will depend on many factors including credit score, loan-to-value ratio,
					property type, loan purpose, and other criteria. Annual Percentage Rate (APR) includes
					interest rate plus certain costs and fees. Rates and APRs shown assume excellent credit and
					best-case scenarios. Not all borrowers will qualify for the lowest rates shown.
				</p>

				<h3 className="h5 fw-semibold mt-4">Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval Notice</h3>
				<p className="text-muted">
					Pre-qualification is an estimate of what you may be able to borrow based on information you
					provide and does not constitute a commitment to lend. Pre-approval involves verification of
					your financial information and credit but still does not guarantee final loan approval, which
					is subject to property appraisal, title review, and final underwriting conditions.
